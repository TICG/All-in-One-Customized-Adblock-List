## Description

This is an all-in-one adblocking filter list that thoroughly blocks trackers, popup ads, ads, unwanted cookies, fake news,
cookie warning messages, unwanted comment sections, crypto-coin mining, YouTube clutter, Twitter guff and social network hassles.

It's been tested in uBlock Origin for Chrome, Firefox and Edge; it should work just
fine in any decent adblocker that supports Adblock Plus 2.0 formatted lists.

It includes customized entries that block particularly annoying page elements.
It is actively maintained (updates every 2 hours) and is saved in UTF-8 format. Have fun :D

**(VITAL:)**
Be sure to disable any lists that appear in the list below that you already have active in
the settings/dashboard. e.g. <https://i.imgur.com/cVyxL7J.png>

This list is very comprehensive and includes around 100 custom-picked adblocking filter lists.
As a basic rule this list includes filter lists that are obtainable at time of generation.

This list focuses on a "distrust website first" basis with an expected whitelisting on the users end
for approved websites.

This repo routinely has old commits cleared out since it updates so often (every two hours).

## Usage

In your adblocker's filter lists section add either the URL:

<https://bit.ly/AIO-adblock>

_OR_

<https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hl2guide/All-in-One-Customized-Adblock-List/master/deanoman-adblocklist.txt>

## News

(as of September 3rd, 2019)

Please only create an issue if you have run into a problem for more than six hours.
This list is updated every two hours so a fix is probably already incoming.

Version 2.8 is now in development, expected for release somewhere around December 2019.

2.8 Alpha 1 is out but I only suggest to the brave early testers who already know how to get a raw link.
Testing Alpha 1 I've already noticed a nice performance boost and smaller size :D

I'm currently working on a related project that offers a detailed tutorial and a consolidated, ordered and deduplicated blocked
hosts list for use in a DNS Sinkhole Server with an encrypted forwarder link.

Using this method should allow users to not use adblockers at all in browsers (a nice performance boost).
Or use them much more sparingly. The DNS Sinkhole Server would also be network-wide and essentially
act as a Pi-Hole device/service alternative without the need to buy and use a Pi-Hole device on a Windows network.

_More development is needed on my end for this before I release it publicly. Any work will appear in my GitHub repos._

## What's in Version 2.7

Version 2.7 of the AIO list is more complete and potent than ever.

* Added more adblocking lists (over 120 in total now)
* Tested browsers: Firefox, Vivaldi, Opera and Chrome
* Tested addons/extensions: uBlock Origin and Adblock Plus

## Windows Recommendations

Personally I:

1. Use a custom Windows HOSTS file to handle the initial blocking. [updated every 2 days]

2. Use my add my AIO list in uBlock Origin within all browsers

3. Clear browser caches often and make sure all cookies are removed

## Credits

Full credit for the actual blocking ability goes to original list creators and maintainers. Thanks so much for their tireless work! :D
